# Python Micro-Enterprise-Service-Bus Module

## 1. Abstract / Preface

*Enterprise Service Bus*, a pretty vague term. Invented by the Gartner-Report 2002. Essential for a large SOA infrastructure.

## 2. Features

Our interpretation of what a ESB should be made of:

- Service Abstraction / Metadata Definition
- Centralized Service / API Registry containing clean XML, JSON Model
- Internal Code (Python) Class / Service XML Mapping
- OOP Relational Database Mapper
- Service Documentation (Auto)-Generation

## 3. Platform As A Service (PaaS)

Also building web-applications on PaaS infrastructure relies on a clean Service Abstraction Model.

>[!NOTE]
> Python **micro-esb** Module will help.

## 4. Current Implementation

- Service Abstraction / Metadata Definition
- Internal Code (Python) Class / Service XML Mapping
- Graph Based / Recursive JSON Result Abstraction

### 4.1. Working On

- OOP Relational Database Mapper
- Service Documentation (Auto)-Generation

## 5. Documentation / Examples
